# 📒 Day 1 Cybersecurity Journey – Detailed Notes (GitHub)

Topic: Web, HTTPS, Cookies, Authentication Bypass

## 🌍 Web & HTTPS
The web is the backbone of online communication, enabling browsers & servers to exchange data.

HTTP vs HTTPS:

**HTTP** = plain text communication.

**HTTPS** = encrypted communication using SSL/TLS certificates → protects against eavesdropping & MITM attacks.

## 🍪 Cookies

What are Cookies?

Small pieces of data are stored locally in your browser.

Used to remember sessions, authentication, and preferences.

**Control:**

You can view, edit, or delete cookies from your browser.

**Tools:** Browser Developer Tools (F12 → Application/Storage → Cookies).

#### 🔑 Cookie Manipulation (Hands-On)

Cookies can store sensitive data like authentication tokens.

By editing or forging cookies, attackers may bypass authentication.

#### 🛠 Tools Used:

 - Browser DevTools – to view and edit cookies.

 - CyberChef – for encoding/decoding values.
