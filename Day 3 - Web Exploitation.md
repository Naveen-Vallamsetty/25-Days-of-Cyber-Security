# üìÖ Day 3 ‚Äì Web Exploitation: Authentication, Dictionary Attacks & Shodan

Today‚Äôs focus:

- Understanding **Authentication** vs **Authorization**
- Risks of **Default Credentials**
- Performing **Dictionary Attacks** via **BurpSuite Intruder**
- Introducing **Shodan** ‚Äî a powerful search engine for internet-connected devices

---

## Authentication vs Authorization

- **Authentication** = Verifying a user‚Äôs identity (e.g., username/password)
- **Authorization** = Defining what an authenticated user is permitted to do
  - Think: login (authentication) versus permissions (authorization)
- These concepts are often misunderstood‚Äîbut are fundamentally different.

---

## The Peril of Default Credentials

- Many systems ship with well-known defaults (e.g., `root:root`, `admin:password`)
- If not changed, these leave systems wide open to intrusion
- Famous example: **Mirai botnet** exploited IoT devices using default login credentials
- **SecLists** (including `rockyou.txt`) is an essential resource for common username/password lists

## Dictionary Attack Workflow with BurpSuite

### What is a dictionary attack?

- Automated credential guessing using pre-made lists (e.g., rockyou.txt)

### Tools you can use:

- **Hydra** ‚Äì Fast network login cracker
- **BurpSuite Intruder** ‚Äì Automates form-based attacks

### Steps in BurpSuite:

1. Proxy login form traffic via Burp (enable Interception) - Browser extension
2. Send captured request to **Intruder**
3. Mark username & password fields as payload positions
4. Load wordlists (e.g., SecLists / rockyou.txt)
5. Launch the attack, monitor for successful login indicators

## What is **Shodan**?

**Shodan** is **a search engine for internet-connected devices**, not web pages.  
It collects metadata‚Äîoften called "banners"‚Äîfrom devices and services connected directly to the internet. This can include server versions, open ports, device types, and more

### Key Use Cases:

- Mapping an organization‚Äôs internet-facing assets
- Discovering IoT devices, cameras, routers, industrial control systems, etc.
- Identifying vulnerable systems‚Äîespecially those running outdated or default-configured software
- Aiding in OSINT, threat hunting, and exposure assessment

### Examples:

- Locating exposed webcams, industrial systems, or databases via Shodan's filters
- Combining Shodan with Metasploit via **AutoSploit**, automating exploitation of exposed services

### Ethical & Defensive Highlights:

- While powerful for security research, Shodan underscores how often **critical infrastructure is inadvertently internet-accessible**
- Organizations must proactively manage and secure exposed endpoints.

## üïµÔ∏è Challenge Answers

Q1: Deploy your AttackBox (the blue "Start AttackBox" button) and the tasks machine (green button on this task) if you haven't already. Once both have deployed, open Firefox on the AttackBox and copy/paste the machines IP (MACHINE_IP) into the browser search bar.
üëâ No answer needed

Q2: Use BurpSuite to brute force the login form. Use the following lists for the default credentials:
| root | root |
| admin | password |
| user | 12345 |

Use the correct credentials to log in to the Santa Sleigh Tracker app. Don't forget to turn off Foxyproxy once BurpSuite has finished the attack!

What is the flag?
